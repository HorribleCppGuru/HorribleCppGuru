- 👋 Hi, I’m @HorribleCppGuru
- 👀 I’m interested in C++
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing, cuz I know everything about C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on C++ and talking about C++
- 📫 How to reach me: When you look in a mirror, say C++ 3 times and I appear very delayed cuz obviously enable_view is too hard to implement on time...
